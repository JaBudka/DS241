<h2>Student survey</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>During the first week of class in Spring 2015, students in an introductory
statistics course at Duke University came up with survey questions designed
to collect data on variables they are interested in working with throughout
the semester. Students answered these questions anonymously in an online
survey, and the resulting data are distributed here. Note that these data
are somewhat cleaned and potentially identifiable cases are removed.
