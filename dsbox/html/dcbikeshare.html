<h2>Bike Rentals In D.C.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole
process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these
systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return
back at another position. As of May 2018, there are about over 1600 bike-sharing programs
around the world, providing more than 18 million bicycles for public use. Today, there
exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic,
environmental and health issues.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the
of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research.
Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel,
departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This
feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used
for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important
events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.
</p>
<p>The dataset comes from
<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>. Sources of the
data itself are
<a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data">Capital Bikeshare</a>,
<a href="http://www.freemeteo.co.uk">freemeteo.co.uk</a> for weather data, and
<a href="http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule">dv.gov</a> for the holiday schedule.
</p>
<p>The data have been modified to better serve the goals of introductory data science education.
