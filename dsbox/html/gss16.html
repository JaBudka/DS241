<h2>Data from the 2016 General Social Survey (GSS)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and
explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes.
Hundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972. In addition, since the GSS
adopted questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 70 years.
The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal
questions, plus topics of special interest. Among the topics covered are civil
liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending
priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events.
